# Advanced-Project
## Project Background
* Live streaming is one of the most important media of social network at present, but its interactivity still has a lot of space to improve. While it flourishes, it also brings some problems.
* Explore new modes of multiplayer online and screen interaction
* Take a critical look at the negative effects that live streaming brings to people while bringing them better interaction
## Project Indroduce
* A live interactive game, players can participate in the game by entering the live channel.
* The game conceptually creates a virtual live channel, and the game's protagonist is the creator.The main character of the game hopes to gain more attention through outdoor live streaming
* Players will see the so-called virtual live stream, which is the game in the project, on the live streaming platform. It also gives instructions to the game through comments and influences the content of the game.
* Player-generated game objects interact with the scripted game protagonist. It affects the health and attention of the game's main character.
* The game had two endings, either a failure due to the death of the main character or a success due to the high level of attention. Therefore, players can choose the more appropriate commands and influence the direction of the game as they wish
* Because of the richness of the ending, players can team up and fight against each other
## Developing Journey
### Preliminary research(2022.6.15-2022.7.01)
* When I worked as an intern in the Artificial Intelligence Department of Tencent, I was responsible for the product planning of AI-related products. In this process, I came up with a direct combination of games and live streaming. Therefore, in the graduation project, I want to put this idea into practice
* In the selection of topics, I hope to combine the knowledge of computational thinking and creative practice in postgraduate courses to critically think about some issues.
* While the live streaming industry is booming and narrowing the distance between each other, it is also quietly influencing creators and audiences. As a live interactive game, choosing this theme as a starting point for the game concept has many benefits.
* There is a high degree of compatibility between the game theme and the game form, which can achieve better results when conveying the theme. At the same time, it is found in the survey that although the live streaming industry has become one of the most important interactive media, the live streaming game is still in a relatively blank field with relatively room for innovation.
* The combination of games and live streaming is called live interactive games. They mainly show the game content to the audience on the live streaming platform, and allow the audience to participate in the game process through comments
* In the process of investigation, it is found that the interactive atmosphere of this category of live broadcast has two directions: one is the instrumental direction with more commercial value and social attributes; the other is the gamification with more interaction and narrative. Since my idea has a high requirement for narrative, I choose the direction of gamification for development.
* In the direction of live-streaming interactive games, a few artists and companies have experimented, the most famous of which is Twitch Play Pokmon. According to the research content of this part, I found some characteristics. Live interactive games are more suitable for games with simple operation, but the equal control of players should be ensured, otherwise it will cause the snatch of control. Because the game allows multiple people to be online at the same time, the interaction between groups during gameplay has the feel of a social experiment. This suggests that this form of gaming needs to take advantage of cooperation and confrontation between users
*Through reading academic reports and news, I think there are two main impacts of live broadcast on people. The first is that people pay too much attention to the attention and ignore the content of live broadcast, thus transferring bad values to the audience. The second is that the audience's thoughts will have an impact on the creator, even more than the creator's own thinking.

* The research at this stage allowed me to determine the theme and main form of the game, and to conduct a series of research on these two directions. Some of the ideas obtained from the research could provide the direction for the subsequent development.
### Game Design (2022.7.02-2022-7.28)
* Game design needs to take into account gameplay systems, numerical balance, interaction design and more. So before the design started, I first played the game and learned from it.
* I chose games with small volume, simple interaction and narrative to experience, including Angry Birds, World Games, Inside, etc. Through experience, I believe that the game design process needs to give full play to the player's decision-making power to ensure the player's experience. In a game mode with limited interaction, such as live interactive games, game AI needs to play a bigger role to make up for this deficiency.
* For the planning of game content, I first investigated some live channels. In these common live channels, I found outdoor sports to be a rich and interesting direction. So I designed my game concept as a virtual outdoor live channel.
* Based on the common elements of outdoor live channels, I designed the following object categories in the game: game environment, animals, plants, props, weather, etc
* At the same time, the game values of different events are designed.

### Development (2022.7.29-2022-9.20)
* In the design process, the first thing is to obtain the technical verification of the broadcast channel comments. In my project mainly through the method of calling the listening function, real-time access to channel comment content. After the code part is completed, connect it to the debug log first, and check whether this part runs successfully by using the string output from the console.

* Create game scenes and personas through blender. And through mixamo to build character bones, and binding character animation.Build all game elements in unity and add the appropriate attributes

* Design the state of the game's protagonist, and script the game AI to control the protagonist's behavior.

* Create status values and text prompts for the game's main character through unity.

* After each section is finished, wire all the scripts together to debug the final effect.
### optimization and evaluation (2022.9.20-2022.10.15)
*  In the process of game optimization and iterative development, 10 people with game development experience or rich game experience were invited to participate in the survey
*  Through discussion, testing and quantitative analysis, I made new requirements for game interaction, AI script and interactive elements in the research process, and made improvements in iterative development.
*  At the end of the development process, put the game on a live streaming platform for open beta testing, continuously observe the data and get feedback. A questionnaire was sent out among the participants to evaluate the usability of the game quantitatively.
